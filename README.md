# seafront

`seafront` is a collection of simple scripts and workflows to download public dataset and make them compatible with Cellxgene standard formats. Made for the Seanome x Frontier Tower hackathon in June 2025.

# Strategy
Cellxgene is the largest and most easily accessible repo for single-cell data, and is highly likely to be amended with further data in the future. It therefore makes sense to take Cellxgene's data standards, and convert other public datasets into that format.
